# Project Title
1-2 sentence description of assignment. Nice to include a screenshot or .gif of the site in action.
For Project #4, we had to use Javascript to create a browser-based divining experience. I decided to make a palmistry website to predict your future.

## About
More in depth details about the project.
The divination experience had to have some sort of input from the participant (i.e. text, button click, form, hover, etc) and give them some sort of output (a written message, an image, a sound, etc).
