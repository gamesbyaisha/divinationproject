# Palmistry 101
For Project #4, we had to use Javascript to create a browser-based divining experience. I decided to make a palmistry website to predict your future.

## About
The divination experience had to have some sort of input from the participant (i.e. text, button click, form, hover, etc) and give them some sort of output (a written message, an image, a sound, etc).
